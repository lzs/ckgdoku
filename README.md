# ckgdoku
Version of ckgedit which allows for switching between native dokuwiki editor tools and ckgedit's tools.  

Installed in its own directory and treated as separate from ckgedit. However, the ckgedit documentation
on Dokuwiki.org applies to ckgedoku as well.

Ckgdoku and ckgedit cannot both be enabled at the same time.
